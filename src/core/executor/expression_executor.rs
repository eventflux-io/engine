// To allow `Box<dyn ExpressionExecutor>` to be `Clone`.
// This requires that all implementors of `ExpressionExecutor` are also `Clone`
// and that their `clone_executor` method correctly reconstructs them.
// However, making the trait itself require Clone (pub trait ExpressionExecutor: Debug + Send + Sync + Clone)
// is often problematic with trait objects. The clone_box pattern (or clone_executor here) is preferred.
// We don't need `impl Clone for Box<dyn ExpressionExecutor>` if we just call `executor.clone_executor()`.
//         self.clone_executor(???) // Problem: clone() doesn't take app_context
//     }
// }
// So, direct calls to `some_box_dyn_exec.clone_executor(ctx)` are better.

// Added Arc import, which might be needed by clone_executor implementations if they store Arc<EventFluxAppContext>
