//! Shared state between Pre and Post state processors
//!
//! This module provides lock-free shared state that allows PreStateProcessor and
//! PostStateProcessor to communicate without requiring locks on each other.
//!
//! ## Design Rationale
//!
//! In Java Siddhi, PostStateProcessor directly calls PreStateProcessor.stateChanged()
//! using ReentrantLock. In Rust, this causes deadlock because:
//! 1. PreStateProcessor is already locked during event processing
//! 2. PostStateProcessor needs to lock it to call methods
//! 3. Rust Mutex is not reentrant → deadlock
//!
//! Solution: Share atomic state that both can access without locking each other.
//!
//! ## Benefits over Java approach:
//! - Lock-free: No contention, faster
//! - No deadlock possibility
//! - Cache-friendly atomic operations
//! - Better for multi-threaded scenarios
