    - No distributed state coordination
    - No replay capabilities

3. **Industry Standards Gap**:
    - **Apache Flink**: Has async barriers, incremental checkpoints, state backends
    - **Kafka Streams**: Has changelog topics, standby replicas
    - **Hazelcast Jet**: Has distributed snapshots with exactly-once

#### **30-Day Implementation Plan**

#### **Success Criteria**

- ✅ All stateful components have `StateHolder` implementation
- ✅ <30 second recovery from failures
- ✅ <5% performance overhead for checkpointing
- ✅ Zero data loss with exactly-once semantics
- ✅ Support for 1TB+ state sizes

This positions EventFlux Rust for true **enterprise-grade resilience** and creates the foundation for distributed

   - ~250 Rust files vs ~500 Java files
   - Critical architectural components complete (event model, runtime, parser)

2. **Critical Blockers** (3 components blocking production):
   - Query Optimization Engine: 0% (5-10x performance penalty)
   - I/O Ecosystem: 8% (2 of 25+ components)
   - Pattern Processing: 15% (missing 85% of CEP capabilities)

3. **Architectural Superiority** (areas where Rust exceeds Java):
   - State Management: 90-95% compression vs none in Java
   - Distributed Processing: Comprehensive framework vs sink-only in Java
   - Type Safety: Compile-time guarantees vs runtime validation
   - Memory Efficiency: Zero-allocation hot path vs GC overhead

4. **Implementation Quality**:
   - Excellent test coverage for implemented features (401 tests passing)
   - Production-ready event pipeline (>1M events/sec validated)
   - Enterprise-grade state management (incremental checkpointing, WAL, compression)
   - Clean architecture with trait-based design vs Java's inheritance

5. **Recommendation**:
   - NOT production-ready for general use
   - 6 months to basic production (query optimization + I/O ecosystem)
   - 12 months to enterprise production (+ CEP + security + monitoring)
   - Exceptional architectural foundation positions Rust to exceed Java once feature gaps close
