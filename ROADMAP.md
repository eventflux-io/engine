- **Target**: Full distributed CEP with horizontal scaling
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRES**: Enterprise-Grade State Management (Priority 2, Task 4) must be completed first
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **REASON**: Distributed processing requires robust state management for:

2. **Compression Type Handling**: 
   - **Issue**: `CompressionType::None` not handled early in pipeline
   - **Fix**: Early return for explicit `None` requests in `compress_state_data()`

3. **Test Reliability**:
   - **Previously**: 6 tests with `#[ignore]` due to hanging issues
   - **Now**: All tests enabled and passing with real compression

**‚úÖ Performance Metrics Achieved**:
