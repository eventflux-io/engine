# Welcome to Eventflux

We're excited to announce the launch of Eventflux, a high-performance Complex Event Processing engine built in Rust.

<!-- truncate -->

## Why Eventflux?

Traditional stream processing engines often sacrifice latency for throughput or require complex configurations for basic use cases. Eventflux takes a different approach:

- **SQL-First**: Write queries in familiar SQL with streaming extensions
- **Rust Performance**: Zero garbage collection, lock-free data structures
- **Enterprise Ready**: Stateful processing with checkpointing and recovery

## Getting Started

Check out our [documentation](/docs/intro) to get started with Eventflux.

Stay tuned for more updates!
