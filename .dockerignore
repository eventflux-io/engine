# Docker Build Context Exclusions
# ==============================================================================
# These files are excluded from the Docker build context to:
# 1. Reduce context size for faster builds
# 2. Exclude files not needed in the final image
#
# Note: this file only controls what is sent as build context; it does not
# affect what ends up inside the final image unless something is `COPY`'d.
